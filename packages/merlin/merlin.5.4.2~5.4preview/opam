Quick setup for VIM
-------------------
Append this to your .vimrc to add merlin to vim's runtime-path:
  let g:opamshare = substitute(system('opam var share'),'\\n$','','''')
  execute "set rtp+=" . g:opamshare . "/merlin/vim"

Also run the following line in vim to index the documentation:
  :execute "helptags " . g:opamshare . "/merlin/vim/doc"

Quick setup for EMACS
-------------------
Add opam emacs directory to your load-path by appending this to your .emacs:
  (let ((opam-share (ignore-errors (car (process-lines "opam" "var" "share")))))
   (when (and opam-share (file-directory-p opam-share))
    ;; Register Merlin
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "emacs/site-lisp" opam-share))
    (autoload 'merlin-mode "merlin" nil t nil)
    ;; Automatically start it in OCaml buffers
    (add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
    (add-hook 'caml-mode-hook 'merlin-mode t)
    ;; Use opam switch to lookup ocamlmerlin binary
    (setq merlin-command 'opam)
    ;; To easily change opam switches within a given Emacs session, you can
    ;; install the minor mode https://github.com/ProofGeneral/opam-switch-mode
    ;; and use one of its "OPSW" menus.
    ))
